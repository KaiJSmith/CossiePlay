<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan - CossiePlay</h1>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Kai Smith<br>
<strong>Login:</strong> jc319521</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>This website will promote CossiePlay to a wider audience and improve customer interaction with the company. The site will also benefit the client by acting as a promotion platform, containing easily accessable information about the business, events and deals, as well as increasing net profit and customers.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p> Success of this website will be measured by evaluating the profit of the company before and after the website going live. More factors of success could be measured by evaluating the number of patrons attending the monthly party, or party sign-ups VIA e-mail.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>The target audience of this website is teenagers to young adults. This will be achieved by the site being compatible with most (if not all) devices. The site will load quickly, having "light" designed pages that can be quickly accessed by every device. The site will also be integrated with social network share buttons and use light imagery and graphics to maintain effortless viewing of important content. The pages will be easily navigated and clean as well as maintaining a common colour theme. Search bars and catagories (which will be used to catagorise products) will be also used for accessability.</p>
